# MCTS based AI opponent for TicTacToe and Connect Four
You can play the games in the terminal by running the main method. Both games take the player's input as 
xy-coordinates (with the top left corner as 00). The AI opponent will then select the most promising move 
 based on a search tree built using Monte Carlo tree search. Specifically the MCTS implementation uses UCT in the 
 selection step of the algorithm.
